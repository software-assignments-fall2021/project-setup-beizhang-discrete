# All in Poker

## Description

We would like to build a platform on which casual poker players can freely play poker with friends, strangers, or against automated opponents. These would be exclusive to casual, non-gambling games, and there would be no monetization or any monetary value to the chips. Currently, the existing platforms for casual poker either don't allow for online play, or feature some form of monetization. This platform would allow users to simply play poker for the love of the game without having to deal with the hassle of the monetary aspects.

## Product Vision Statement

There are two essential components to this project. The first is ability for users to connect with one another online and be able to interact with one another in real time, in groups of up to 7 players. The second is a functional framework for playing Poker - specifically, Texas Hold-'em. There is potential for more social aspects as well as for AI players, but those are secondary to the primary goal: Simply to allow people to play a game of poker online.

The Minimum Viable Product for this project is an application that allows users to create and join tables, where those players will be able to play normal games of Texas Hold-'em with the other players seated at that table online, synchronously. When creating a table, the user should be able to define specifications about the game they will create, such as maximum number of players, starting stack sizes, and blind sizes. The created tables would likely be viewable in a large list, where players may join and participate in games. The Poker playing aspect should be fully functional: Players should be able to see their hands, the cards in the center, the amount of chips each players has as well as the chips in the pot. The ability to check/call, raise, and fold should be available.

There are other features not listed above: Chat functionality, Friends systems, and automated opponents. While these features are certainly within our vision for the final product, and some are perhaps more important than others, they are not strictly necessary for the cre requirements of what we want our product to accomplish.
